    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Heat peanut oil in a large deep skillet over medium-low heat; cook and
        stir yellow curry powder, ginger, and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir coconut milk into curry paste mixture until well blended. Stir paprika and salt into coconut milk mixture; add chicken and cook until chicken is about half-cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Stir chicken stock, potatoes, onion, green bell pepper, carrot, brown sugar,
        and bay leaf into coconut milk-chicken mixture; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Cover skillet and cook for about 2 more minutes. Serve over rice.
