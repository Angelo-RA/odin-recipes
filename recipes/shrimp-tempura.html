        Served as an appetizer, main dish, or finger food.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 large egg whites, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>  
    <p>
        Whisk flour, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl; make a well in the center.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>  
    <p>
        Pour water and egg yolk into the well and mix just until moistened; batter will be lumpy. Stir in egg whites.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>  
    <p>
        Dip one shrimp at a time into batter to coat; do not batter tails.

    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>  
    <p>
        When three shrimp have been battered, carefully place them into the deep fryer and fry until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>  
    <p>
        Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp, battering a few at a time while the previous batch is cooking.
