    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 egg</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 can tuna</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>cheese to taste</li>
        <li>2 leaves parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add bell pepper and saute for around 4-5 mins, until soft. Add to a small mixing bowl along with the tuna and parsley. Stir to combine and break down any large chunks of tuna.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        In a jug mix together the eggs and milk. 
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Return pan to stove top over medium heat. Add the remaining oil and as it heats swirl it all around the pan so the base and sides are coated. When the oil begins to shimmer add the egg mixture and swirl around the pan to cover the base.
        Let your eggs cook for around 30 seconds, then use a rubber spatula to carefully draw the edges of the omelette in towards the centre. This should allow the liquid egg to run off the surface into the spaces created.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Top one half of the omelette with half the cheese, then the tuna mixture and finally the remaining cheese. Cover with a lid and cook for around 30 seconds.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Using a spatula or fish slice work it under the side of the omelette with no filling. Fold the egg over itself to cover the filling.
