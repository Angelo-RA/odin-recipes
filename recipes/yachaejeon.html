    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This crispy, healthy,  delicous, simple vegetarian pancake is a traditional Korean favorite with a lot of flavor and room for variation.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 green onions, cut into 1 inch long</li>
        <li>⅓ cup leek (optional), sliced thinly 1 inch long</li>
        <li>3 ounces zucchini matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 green chili pepper (or jalapeño), optional, sliced</li>
        <li>3 ounces onion, sliced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sweet potato</li>
        <li>1 fresh mushroom (white, baby portobello, or shiitake)</li>
        <li>¾ cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Combine green onion, leek (if using), zucchini, green chili pepper (if using), onion, and sweet potato in a bowl. Add flour salt, and ¾ cup water. Mix it well with a wooden spoon.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Heat up a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. I use my 12 inch non-stick skillet to make one big pancake, but if your skillet is small, you can work in batches to make smaller ones.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Add about 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and swirl it around to coat the skillet evenly. Add the batter to the skillet and spread it out evenly.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Turn down the heat to medium and put the sliced mushroom on top. Gently press them in with a wooden spoon or spatula.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the bottom turns crunchy light golden brown. Grab the handle of the skillet and twirl it around so the pancake moves and is cooked evenly underneath.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Turn or flip over the pancake.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
        Increase the heat to medium high and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil along the edges of the pancake. Lift up one edge with your spatula and tilt the skillet so the oil flows underneath the pancake.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>
        Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until both sides turn light golden brown, occasionally pressing down with the spatula.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 9</h4>
    <p>
        Flip it over one more time and cook another 2 minutes.
